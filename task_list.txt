TODO:

--Implement a better game loop

--Create a renderable  world
  - represent as a grid
  - OR represent as a list of hitboxes
    - Figure out how to store the hitboxes
    - Could be stored as a hashmap that contains a bunch of arrays whose keys
      are the chunk they represent. And each array contains all the hitboxes in
      that chunk

--Find a way to use shaders
  - This may mean not being able to use pygame

--Add interpolation to avoid jitter, if it becomes an issue

DONE:
--Get pygame working
